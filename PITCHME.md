## Motivation...
Note:
 - Working with friend who has a publishing company and wants to revamp a topo map and hiking guide of the local area that they had made previously.
 - Make a topo map of Squamish from scratch on a limited budget.
 - Squamish in the background - mountainous terrain

### Inspiration
Ordnance survey
@snapend
Note:
- National mapping agency in UK
- Always like the level of detail on the map and the ability of the contours to really highlight the terrain
